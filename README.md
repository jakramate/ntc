Noise Tolerence Classifiers

A library of label-noise robust classifiers written in Julia


The library will include
- robost Normal Discriminant Analysis
- robust Logistic Regression (with random label noise model)
- robust Multinomial Logistic Regression (with random label noise model)
- a kernelised version of the above
- robust Logistic Regression (with non-random label noise model)
- robust k-nearest neightbour algorithm
- robust boosting algorithm based on AdaBoost
